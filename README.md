# Producing-Keywords-for-Google-Ads
A prototype set of keywords for search campaigns is Google adwords – selecting an appropriate keywords that are most probable to occur in clicks and sales. Keyword research is part of science and part of art. It's about having a variety of resources at your side, but it's also about knowing your customers and anticipating which words they're actually entering the search box. That’s the best way to ensure that your ads show up at the right time and in the right place: when they’re searching for the kinds of products or services you offer.

Keywords can be broadly organized into the following types:

* Brand/product terms – any keywords containing your brand name and trademarked terms.
* Generic terms – terms relating to products (e-commerce keywords) or services offered.
