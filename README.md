# Producing-Keywords-for-Google-Ads
#### Abstract 
Internet advertising has been the fastest growing advertising channel in recent years, with paid search ads comprising the bulk of this revenue. Search clicks and purchase intent are correlated, we show that returns from paid search are a fraction of non‐experimental estimates. As an extreme case, we show that brand keyword ads have no measurable short‐term benefits. For non‐brand keywords, we find that new and infrequent users are positively influenced by ads but that more frequent users whose purchasing behavior is not influenced by ads account for most of the advertising expenses, resulting in average returns that are negative.


A prototype set of keywords for search campaigns is Google adwords – selecting an appropriate keywords that are most probable to occur in clicks and sales. Keyword research is part of science and part of art. It's about having a variety of resources at your side, but it's also about knowing your customers and anticipating which words they're actually entering the search box. That’s the best way to ensure that your ads show up at the right time and in the right place: when they’re searching for the kinds of products or services you offer.

Keywords can be broadly organized into the following types:

* Brand/product terms – any keywords containing your brand name and trademarked terms.
* Generic terms – terms relating to products (e-commerce keywords) or services offered.
